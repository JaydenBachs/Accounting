                    <p>There are plenty of places to stay active and relax on campus, like the sports complexes and dining halls. Living on campus is convenient and helps us feel connected. One thing we could use more of is specialized accounting resources and maybe some classes on sustainability in accounting. But overall, the university is a fantastic place for accounting students to learn and grow!</p>
