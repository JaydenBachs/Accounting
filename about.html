                OBJECTIVES
                The Department of Accounting aims to produce high-level graduates in Accounting, Taxation, Entrepreneurship and Financial Management who will contribute, through research and publications to the growth of Accounting knowledge and the improvement of the quality of professional practice in Nigeria and on the international scene. Other specific objectives are to:
                
                Expand the scope of application of the Accounting, Taxation, Entrepreneurship & Financial Management disciplines in order to promote and enhance national economic development. In this regard the Department seeks to stimulate interest, and provide needed leadership in research and experimentation in all branches of Accountancy, Taxation, Entrepreneurship and Financial Management;
                Sensitize on the need of the professional in Accounting and Taxation to see himself/herself as a member of the organizational team whose collaborative effort is required in order to achieve organizational objectives. This requires that the Accountant or Taxation expert should have a reasonable grounding in all aspects of Economics, Computer and Management in addition to his/her specialization;
                Inculcate requisite attitudes, ethics and skills of professionalism in accounting. To this end, student and staff interaction with the everyday practitioner is encouraged and facilitated through the Industrial Training Programme of the Department;
                Inculcate moral and spiritual values in the graduates of the Department. Such values are expected to permeate their thinking, and moderate their behaviour always, whether in the classroom, industry or private practice;
                Facilitate the creation of the entrepreneurial spirit among young men and women who can help to exploit the available resources and opportunities in the country and elsewhere;
                Produce accounting and taxation teachers and researchers in order to keep pace with the ever-rising standards for accounting and taxation education in the world;
                Facilitate the education and training of accountants, taxation practitioners and financial managers and SME owners; and
                Help produce teaching materials and literature more appropriate to the Nigerian environment through research and cross fertilization of ideas in the classroom.</p>
